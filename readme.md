# Kristal Framework
Kristal Framework is a lightweight PHP framework built on the MVC architecture. It was designed as an alternative to Laravel, offering a simpler and more intuitive development flow while still providing the core features needed to build complex web applications.


## Important
1. This framework is a personal tool created to match the exact development style and flow I prefer. It may not fit the needs or preferences of other developers. If you wish to customize it, feel free to create your own fork.
2. The framework has not been reviewed by security professionals. It may contain vulnerabilities and should be used with caution in production environments.
3. Updates are made only when needed for my own projects. Development may be irregular, paused, or end entirely depending on my personal needs.


## License
The framework is released under the MIT License, allowing anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute it.


## Server Requirements
* Web Server: Apache or LiteSpeed with .htaccess support
* PHP: version 8.3
* PHP Extensions: imagick and pdo
* Composer: Required for managing backend dependencies


## Installing
1. Rename 'config-example.php' to 'config.php' and configure the framework settings.
2. Upload the framework files to a server or local development environment.
3. Run 'composer install --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader' at the root folder to install dependencies from composer.json file.

After completing these steps, access your server's URL to view the built-in demo page.


## Troubleshooting
Because this is a personal project, full compatibility with every hosting environment is not guaranteed. If you encounter issues, feel free to reach out at 'hennakristal@outlook.com'. Your feedback helps improve both the framework and its documentation.
